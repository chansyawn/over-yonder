# Domain Docs

This is a single-context repository.

## Before exploring, read these

- `CONTEXT.md` at the repository root.
- Relevant ADRs under `docs/adr/`.

If these files do not exist, proceed silently. Do not flag their absence or suggest creating them upfront. The `/domain-modeling` skill creates them lazily when terms or decisions are resolved.

## File structure

```text
/
├── CONTEXT.md
├── docs/adr/
└── src/
```

## Use the glossary's vocabulary

When output names a domain concept, use the term defined in `CONTEXT.md`. Do not drift to synonyms the glossary explicitly avoids.

If a needed concept is absent, reconsider whether the term belongs to the project or note the gap for `/domain-modeling`.

## Flag ADR conflicts

If output contradicts an existing ADR, surface the conflict explicitly instead of silently overriding it.
